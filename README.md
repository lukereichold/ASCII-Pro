##ASCII Pro!
ASCII Pro! is a free utility iPhone app [on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ascii-pro!/id447528726?mt=8) that translates between ASCII text, binary, hexadecimal, base 64, and ASCII decimal character codes.

For example: an entry of "app" into the "ASCII Text" field would calculate as "01100001 01110000 01110000", "61 70 70", "YXBw", and "97 112 112" for binary, hexadecimal, base64, and ASCII decimals, respectively.

While the code in this project works most of the time, any suggestions or modifications would be welcome.
